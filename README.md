## What do you need to make this work?

> Give a complete list of prerequisites for using your app, and include links to other New Relic features when necessary.
>
> For example:

Required:

- [New Relic Infrastructure agent(s) installed](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent#infra-install) on your cloud computing devices and the related access to [New Relic One](https://newrelic.com/platform).

You'll get the best possible data out of this application if you also:

- [Activate the EC2 integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-infrastructure) to group by your cloud provider account.
- [Install APM on your applications](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent#apm-install) to group by application.

## Getting started

> Include a step-by-step procedure on how to get your app installed and deployed. The clone and deploy steps are similar across all apps. If your app has additional steps required to get started, include them here or in their own section.

1. First, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following command(s) (If you have them installed these commands will return a version number, if not, the commands won't be recognized):
```bash
git --version
npm -v
```
2. Next, install the [NR1 CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) by going to [this link](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) and following the instructions (5 minutes or less) to install and setup your New Relic development environment.
3. Next, to clone this repository and run the code locally against your New Relic data, execute the following command:

```bash
nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-vividcortex.git
cd nr1-vividcortex
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```

Visit [https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), navigate to the Nerdpack, and :sparkles:

## Deploying this Nerdpack

> Include the necessary steps to deploy your app. Generally, you shouldn't need to change any of these steps.

Open a command prompt in the nerdpack's directory and run the following commands.

```bash
# If you need to create a new uuid for the account to which you're deploying this Nerdpack, use the following
# nr1 nerdpack:uuid -g [--profile=your_profile_name]
# to see a list of APIkeys / profiles available in your development environment, run nr1 credentials:list
nr1 nerdpack:publish [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:deploy [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
```

## What do you need to make this work?

### Storing your VividCortex API key

Your VividCortex API key is stored with New Relic Oneâ€™s `UserStorage` APIs. `UserStorage` data is accessible only to the user account and Nerdpack which created it. The data is encrypted in transmission, but is not encrypted at rest (within the underlying database). Because of this, `UserStorage` data may be accessible to a New Relic employee via an administrative privilege in the platform.
